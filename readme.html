<h1>
  RTJam - Real Time Jam
</h1>
<p>
  RTJam is software that runs on Linux (Raspberry Pi OS and others) that uses low latency Voice over IP (VoIP) to create a virtual room for musicians to collaborate in real time.
  It's just super low latency audio conferencing. Time delay from player to player is about 25msec. I needed to get my music fix during the pandemic and nothing else I could find 
  worked reliably.

  The code is open source and can be found at
  <a href="https://github.com/mfvargo/rtjam">GitHub</a>
</p>
<p>
  You can listen in to the lobby of the jam room live! (see the calendar below for when something might be happening there)<br/>

  Here is a video of a six person jam!<br/>

  The audio for the clip was from my feed (what I was hearing in my headphones). All six of us were playing simultaneously from various locations.  I did not edit the audio stream
  in the video.  I got the video clips from everybody that was playing and stitched the video together.  The audio stream in that video is exactly what we were all hearing when
  playing together.
